              <h2>Are there stumbling blocks making your organization less efficient and less productive?</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
              Sometimes companies and organizations know what they need, and how technology can help.
              But often, there are hidden, <strong>seemingly small annoyances</strong> that interfere with
              employees' ability to be productive and efficient.  Employees may not want to complain about <strong>"the
              little things"</strong> (especially the ones they assume can't be changed), and so those in position to
              make changes never hear about them.
            </p>
            <p>
              These little annoyances can add up.  <strong>Employees want to be productive</strong>, and enough little
              hurdles and barriers to productivity lead to <strong>increased employee frustration</strong> and turnover,
              in addition to the more obvious wasted time and resources.  Eliminating these annoyances benefits both
              the organization and the employees.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is where our <strong>Efficiency Survey</strong> comes in.  We work with you to give your
              employees access to a proprietary, anonymous survey we've developed and will customize for your organization,
              inviting your employees to think about and communicate these annoyances, big and small.  We analyze
              the results, and provide you with both a high-level summary and (if you want it) the raw survey data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond illuminating these hidden inefficiencies, we can work with you to brainstorm what to do about
              them.  In particular, we'll propose some ways we think we can help you <strong>improve employee
              productivity</strong> through technology, either custom or off-the-shelf as appropriate.  If you don't
              take us up on that, no problem -- <strong>we're glad to have helped</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>

                  I like to take on big-scope challenges, the sort where it's not fully clear what form the solution
                  should take; the more brainstorming required, the more proud I am of the result.  I usually design
                  and implement software systems, but hardware excites me more.  In my spare time, I've found myself
                  dabbling in robotics, semi-automated beer brewing, and medical assistive devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'm comfortable discussing problems and solutions with stakeholders of all kinds.  Even while digging
                  in and working on a challenging component, I make a point of keeping one eye on the bigger
                  picture in order to ensure my team and I are making the biggest impact we can.

                  Few things make me happier than seeing data visualized, and double points if its on a map! My passion
                  is building interactive applications that convey a data driven message. No data is too big or too
                  small to see itself telling a story!

                  interesting, fun and relatable to be shared with others is always the goal.

                  I grew up a child of DOS 1.0 and 80's bulletin board systems and I have been
                  enthralled with technology from then on.  At 16, I moved to Toronto to study special effects make-up, then went on to produce television shows and extreme sports movies.  After graduating college, I moved to New York City and developed 3D visual merchandising software for J Crew, Disney, Liz Claiborne, and Victoria's Secret.

                  A successful career with the US Army as an Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technician taught me to
                  professionally break all manner of things for the safety of others.  This led me to deep understanding
                  of the weakness of materials, and how to make them better.  There are safe solutions to hazardous

                  I'm passionate about analyzing and deconstructing complex problems in order to anticipate obstacles early. I get excited
                  about robust, reliable automation. Seeing patterns and connecting the dots between concepts and hard data makes me smile.
                  I work hard to build bespoke solutions from standardized components.

                  Whether it's a fascination with music, health, games, cooking, history, software, or any other of my many interests, I
                  get hooked and stubborn while yearning to hone my skills.  There's a sense of urgency that I experience when something
                  comes to me worth solving or reflecting upon, and in computer science, there's certainly no shortage of brilliant solutions
                  and interesting problems worth thinking about.

                <p>Pursuing a career in software development is one of the best decisions I've made for myself.  It compliments my enjoyment
                  of getting lost in my work while being an avenue through which I feel I can impart some sort of positive change in this
                  technological world of ours.

                  I combined my two passions of problem solving and art into one - graphic design. My continual aim is to create clean,
                  concise designs that express a novel in the time of an elevator pitch. Throwing ideas at the wall, seeing what sticks,
                  and scraping away the excess has always produced the highest quality product.
